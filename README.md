# SyncUp
This program syncs up Pandora, Spotify and iTunes. The HTTP library Requests posts the login information for Pandora, and retrieves the liked songs from the user’s account. Then, with the Spotify API, Spotify playlists are created that corresponded to the Pandora stations. Songs are added to each playlist that have been liked on that station. Next, a server-side mitmproxy monitors http traffic between the user’s computer and Pandora. When the skip limit or an advertisement is reached, the Pandora session quits and Spotify is opened, playing a song from the playlist for the current station. A Selenium WebDriver opens a Pandora window with the proxy server configuration while a parallel process listens for http traffic. In addition, Python’s os module finds the names of iTunes songs and creates a Spotify iTunes playlist. Once the Spotify song is done playing, a new Pandora window will open or iTunes will begin playing depending on the user’s configuration.
